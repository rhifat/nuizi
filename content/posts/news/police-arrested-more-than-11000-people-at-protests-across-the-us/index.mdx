Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Emphasis
---

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Code and Syntax Highlighting
---

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var args = []; // Empty array, at first.
for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
  args.push(arguments[i])
} // Now 'args' is an array that holds your arguments.
console.log(args);
```

```sh
// sh code sample
yarn add gatsby
gatsby develop
```

## Blockquotes
---

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Tables
---

| Order ID | Name                    | Price   | Color |   |
|----------|-------------------------|---------|-------|---|
| 200398   | iPhone X 64Gb Grey      | $999.00 | White |   |
| 205457   | Samsung S8 Black        | $756.00 | Black |   |
| 357895   | Game Console Controller | $22.00  | Red   |   |
| 345677   | USB 3.0 Cable           | $199.00 | Gold  |   |
| 577633   | Smartwatch 4.0 LTE Wifi | $395.00 | Blue  |   |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

## Lists
---

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   * Unordered sub-list.

1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
   4. And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

## Embed Videos

With the use of `gatsby-remark-embed-video` plugin you can easily embed videos from Youtube, Vimeo, Twitch and more sources.

## Task List
---

- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](),
**formatting**, and <del>tags</del>
supported
- [x] list syntax required (any
unordered or ordered list
supported)

## Headers
---

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1

## Links
---

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to an internal page](../contact)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
